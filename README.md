# Pandas Tricks & Pitfalls

Clone this repo and run `ipython notebook` on your computer.


* **pandas_tricks.ipynb** - this is the main notebook, where I document some useful pandas features with lots of notes
* **pandas_exercises.ipynb** - supplemental exercises. Not everything from the tricks notebook has exercises, I don't wanna inundate ya.

* http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/ The pandas docs are generally good, but they're dense and take time to get through.
