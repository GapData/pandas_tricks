# Pandas Tricks & Pitfalls

Clone this repo and run `ipython notebook` on your computer.


* **pandas_tricks.ipynb** - this is the main notebook, where I document some useful pandas features with lots of notes
* **pandas_exercises.ipynb** - supplemental exercises. Not everything from the tricks notebook has exercises, I don't wanna inundate ya.
